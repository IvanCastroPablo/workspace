let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = z + y;
alert(z);

// Exercise 1.5
/* On one single line, declare three variables with the following names and values:

x = 10;
y = 5;
x += y;

// Exercise 2.5
// Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).

x = 10;
y = 5;
x *= y;

// Exercise 3.1
// Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:

let length = 16;            //number
